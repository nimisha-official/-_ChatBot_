# 🤖 Fun Chatbot with Groq LLM

This project is a lightweight, friendly chatbot built using **Streamlit** and **Groq’s `mistral-saba-24b`** model with real-time streaming support. It responds in a fun, supportive, and witty style — perfect for casual conversations, quick questions, or just a good laugh.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a message via the Streamlit chat UI.
2. The chatbot responds using Groq-hosted LLM (`mistral-saba-24b`), streaming the response live.
3. A fun and engaging tone is used to mimic a witty and friendly companion.
4. Conversation history is stored in the browser session using Streamlit's session state.
